Topic: Doing a software that helps keep score for cricket games

Your program must keep track of the two opposing teams. The user should be able to enter data on a ball-by-ball basis. 
Each ball should result in either a hit (with an amount of runs attached), a wide, a no-ball or a pass ball (with an amount of runs attached). 
The program should keep track of overs, providing indication when it’s time to swap ends. It should also keep track of outs, 
storing the bowler’s name whenever a batter gets out.
