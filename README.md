Topic: Cricket Score Tracking software

Your program must keep track of the two opposing teams. The user should be able to enter data on a ball-by-ball basis. 
Each ball should result in either a hit (with an amount of runs attached), a wide, a
 no-ball or a pass ball (with an amount of runs attached). 
The program should keep track of overs, providing indication when it’s time to swap ends. It should also keep track of outs, 
storing the bowler’s name whenever a batter gets out.

The score tracking program is written in Python, using tkinter and customtkinter modules to create a functional and good looking GUI, making
use of the variety of widgets and functions in the modules allow for creative Ui design.
